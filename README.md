# Klipper Config for XoneFobic's Ender 3 v2

## SLICER

As I use superslicer, all settings in this section are aimed for it.  
Convert them as needed to your slicer of choice.

### Print Settings

As I enable ArcWelding in the klipper settings, I also add it to the `Post-processing script` in the `Output options` section.  
Look in the docs of the ArcWelder script you're using to know what to apply here.  
I use the Windows version of [ArcWelderLib](https://github.com/FormerLurker/ArcWelderLib) by FormerLurker. In this case just add `C:\path\to\bin\ArcWelder.exe` to the `Post-processing script` section.

### Filament Settings

#### Start G-code
Obviously, change these values as needed.  
```
; Polymaker Polylite PLA
SET_PRESSURE_ADVANCE ADVANCE=0.0275
```

### Printer settings

Within the `General` tab, make sure to turn on `Use relative E distances`. The `START_PRINT` and `PRIME_LINE` macro are set up to be relative instead of absolute.  
  
#### Start G-code
```
START_PRINT BED_TEMP=[first_layer_bed_temperature] EXTRUDER_TEMP={first_layer_temperature[initial_extruder]+extruder_temperature_offset[initial_extruder]}
```

#### End G-code
```
END_PRINT
```

#### Before layer change G-code
```
;BEFORE_LAYER_CHANGE
G92 E0
;{layer_z}
```
